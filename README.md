OVERVIEW

The Car Evaluation dataset, sourced from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, features a collection of car evaluations based on various attributes. These attributes include the buying price, maintenance cost, door count, seating capacity, trunk space, and safety ratings, all aimed at assessing a car's acceptability. This dataset is characterized by categorical variables like the purchase price, upkeep expenses, door quantity, seating capability, boot space, and safety assessment, with no missing entries. The primary outcome of interest, denoted as 'class', classifies each car's evaluation from unacceptable to very good.
